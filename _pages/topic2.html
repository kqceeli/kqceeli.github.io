<h1>Topic 2: Uncertainty Quantification & Propagation in Geomaterials</h1>

<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>Geomaterials exhibit multiscale characteristics, but the propagation of uncertainties across different scales is still unclear. A comprehensive understanding of multiscale behaviors is critical for producing accurate and reliable geotechnical predictions.</p>

<h2>Contribution</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Investigated how microstructural heterogeneity impacts macroscopic anisotropy and developed theoretical models to quantify effective transport properties of geomaterials at multiscale.</li>
    <li>Introduced a practical upscaling method to accurately assess anisotropy in thermal and hydraulic properties.</li>
</ul>
